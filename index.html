        <p>Bio:  Hi, my name is Evan Jensen and I am 25 (almost 26) years old. I am married to my beautiful wife Kristen and we have two beautiful daughters; Everly (3.5) and Marley (3 months). I live in Las Vegas Nevada and have been here for about 3 years. I was born and raised in Eastern Washington State but moved to Utah when I turned 19. I had lived there for 3 days when I met my wife and the rest is history. We were married 10 months later and now have a beautiful family! I have experience in the food industry as well as a lot of sales experience.</p>
